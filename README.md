# OneDrive Reset Script
I created a script to reset OneDrive.
- Since OneDrive can have different folder locations, I made sure to let the script check all of them.
- I added some lines to display what it's doing.
- I didn't want it to spit out errors, so I let it check for them and display custom error text.
- I didn't want the OneDrive and Microsoft Store windows to be opened, so I made them close after the reset was successful.

=====================
      CHANGELOG
=====================
- v2.0
  - rewrote the whole script
    - should have a better structure
